# PWM_Sprayer_Teensy_code

Thanks to Matt Elias for the class structured AOG machine code  https://github.com/m-elias/AOG-Machine.  I just added the PWM to it.  Also thanks to whiterose on the AOG forum for the help with curcuits for the PWM driver board.  I accidently found some that work better than what I made, thanks anyway whiterose!

A working, cost effective PWM sprayer.  This is a companion app to Ag Open GPS.  To learn more https://discourse.agopengps.com/  Communication is via UDP between this app and the teensy 4.1.

Features include; -  On/Off valve control  -  PWM valve control  -  Turn compensation  -  Staggered valve control  -  User definable Hz.

The solenoid: It only draws .4 amps in my testing. I can measure 15 Hz and my non scientific tester is, blow thru it and if you feel wind on the other side it must work at that Hz rate, I quit at 50 Hz.

This AOG compatible controller a Teensy 4.1 W/Ethernet and 2 MCP23017-E/SP-ND will get you 64 individually controlled nozzles. You'll need a PWM driver for each valve and a diode.

The negatives would be that the components aren’t designed for ag chemicals and won’t last.  At $6.95 you can replace a valve a bunch of times before you’re even money with a Raven/Capstan or your favorite flavor of valve.
